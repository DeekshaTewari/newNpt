scripts/view/@ispikes/private/GenerateSessionSpikeTrains.m: The way the number of clusters was previously deduced was not working if ww had several overlap clusters
RodrigoChangeLog.txt: 
scripts/view/@eyemvt/subsref.m: 
algorithms/eye/EyeMvtAlgo.m: New function renamed from fvtGenerateSessionEyeMovements. Output modified to facilitate object creation. Histogram measures from eyemovement object (e.g. velocity, amplitude, etc) was also added to this function.

scripts/batch_processor/ProcessSession.m: To enable the function to work even with empty fields
scripts/view/@eyemvt/get.m: To avoid confusions between some properties that go either to the plot or to the get function 
scripts/view/@eyemvt/eyemvt.m: The old function dirLevel was changed to the new one(getDataDirs
scripts/view/@eyemvt/plot.m: To fix some bug about the indices that occurred when a specific set of data was selected

scripts/view/gui/InspectCB.m: Changes to compute the correct number of events to display when that number does not necessary corresponds to the number of events in the object 
algorithms/eye/EyeMvtAlgo.m: Modifications to enable the tracking of all the trials eventhough there were no saccades and fixations. Also some corrections to recognize more previously missed saccades
scripts/view/@nptdata/name2index.m: Changes to compute the correct number of events to display when that number does not necessary corresponds to the number of events in the object
