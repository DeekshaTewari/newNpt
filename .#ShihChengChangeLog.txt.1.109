July 16, 2001
nptWritSorterHDR: renamed to nptWriteSorterHDR.
	changed format of header slightly to make reading back easier.
nptReadSorterHDR: created to return header info.
nptReadDatFile:	updated help message.

July 17, 2001
ProcessDay: Moved ProcessSession call into a separate loop after files 
	have been moved.

July 20, 2001
GenerateSessionSpikeTrains: Changed session structure so that we can 
	store the session name, and max trial duration in the structure.
InspectSpikes: Renamed from CheckingSorting. Updated to use the new 
	session structure. Fixed bug that was rounding up a integer instead 
	of a float.

July 30, 2001
GenerateSessionSpikeTrains: Added signal number as an argument so that a 
	signal field is added to the session structure to store signal 
	number in the raw streamer file so that InsepectSpikes won't need 
	any additional information. 
InspectSpikes: Updated to use signal number in the session structure 
	instead of requiring an additional argument to specify the signal 
	number.
				
July 31, 2001
nptHighPass: Use filtfilt instead of filter to eliminate phase shifts in
	the filtered signal.
nptLfpFilter2: Use filtfilt instead of filter to eliminate phase shifts 
	in the filtered signal.
AutomatedScript: Moved check for marker file to ProcessDay.
ProcessDay: Now checks for marker file before proceeding.
ProcessSession: Fixed bug that did not create marker file when done
	processing. Added check to make sure ini file is not a RF file
	before trying to read it to see if it is a calibration session.
nptReadSorterHdr: Added channel order in streamer file to the list of 
	return parameters.

August 1, 2001
InspectSpikes: Fixed bug that left out a close parenthesis in checking 
	for the presence of highpass in the session name.
nptLfpFilter2: Changed filter cutoffs to 1-150 Hz. 
ProcessDay: Changed marker name to processday.txt so there are no 
	confusions with other scripts.
ProcessSession: Changed marker name to processsession.txt so there are 
	no confusions with other scripts.
ProcessEyeSessions: Changed marker name to processeyes.txt so there are 
	no confusions with other scripts.

August 2, 2001

	day.
ProcessSession: Added check for file skip.txt to see if we should skip 
	the	session.

	skip the session.
nptLfpFilter2: Removed for loop used in resampling the data.

August 3, 2001
nptLfpFilter2: Need to call butter each time since we are running into
	problems with the round off error in the coefficients when
	we specify them in the script.
ProcessSession: Changed filenames for lfp and highpass to the following
	format sessionname_lfp0001.bin and sessionname_highpass0001.bin.
	Added extra fprintf at the end to return prompt to the usual
	place. Added check to make sure there were ini files in a
	directory before proceeding, e.g. when we place a dxy file in a 
	dummy session just so we can use the eye data.
ProcessEyeSessions: Fixed bug that forgot to create processedeyes.txt 
	when done with each session. Added extra fprintf at the end to 
	return prompt to the usual place. 
ProcessDay: Updated to use new naming format. Reversed order of moving 
	eye and eyefilt files because of new naming format.
nptHighPass: Now calls butter each time to get the proper coefficients. 
	Also transposes data since filtfilt takes data in columns. The
	filtered data is transposed back since extractor expects data
	in rows.
				
August 4, 2001
InspectSpikes: Added 'zoom on' to allow interactive magnification. Will 
	now use current figure if there is one instead of creating a new
	figure each time.

	to lowercase characters if run on anything other than PC or Mac
	platforms.

September 5, 2001

	neuron spelling.
nptExtructor: Now takes mean of clipped data as argument instead of 
	calculating	the mean from unclipped data.
nptWriteDat: Fixed neuron spelling.

September 6, 2001
ExtractorWrapper: Fixed bug that didn't store the means and thresholds
	separately for the different groups. Updated comments. 
ProcessSession: Now keeps the means and thresholds for the different 
	groups separate. Now loops over groups after extraction and calls 
	nptWriteDat and nptWriteSorterHdr separately.
nptWriteDat: Now just writes DAT file instead of looping over groups and 
	calling nptWriteSorterHdr.
nptWriteSorterHdr: Now writes means and thresholds used in extraction
	for each trial.
GenerateSessionSpikeTrains: Fixed bug that failed to set gdfsize when 
	gdf's are not being used. Now reads in means and thresholds for each
	trial from the HDR files created by the extraction functions.

	on raw data.
				
September 7, 2001
GenerateSessionSpikeTrains: Updated comments.

	order to retain backward compatability with old data. Added quit 
	key.

nptLfpFilter2: Added command to transpose the filtered data back into 
	the same form as the input data, i.e. each channel is in a row.
ProcessSession: Renamed groupfilename to rawfilename when calling to 
	avoid confusion when calling nptWriteSorterHdr. Added scanorders for 
	eye, lowpass, broadband so that when nptWriteStreamerFile is called, 
	it has only the relevant channels.
				
September 12, 2001
InspectSpikes: Updated comments. Added clear data command to improve 
	memory usage. Added check to avoid reading first trial twice.

	trials in a session. Can also be used to look at lfp and high pass 
	signals.

September 13, 2001

	failed to convert eye positions to screen coordinates for 
	experimental sessions.
InspectDatFile: Fixed bug that prevented the first trial from being 
	displayed after the start.

	axis. Uses the new limits object to keep track of max and min values 
	of the y-axis.
@nptdata/InspectGUI: InspectGUI method that used to be stand-alone 
	InspectGUI function. Now checks object's HoldAxis property as well

	nptdata through the inheritance from streamer. Now passes any 
	unknown	properties to get method in streamer class, which will pass 
	any unknown properties to get method in nptdata class.
	
Jan 14, 2002

	timing.mat file created by ProcessSession. Added option to specify
	duration instead of just onsets and offsets.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/plot: Removed redundant 'All' option.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/subsref: New function to access object data.

June 1, 2004
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Removed 'SessionCells' argument in
	examples.
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessSession: Moved conversion of 
	trigDurations to time out of loop and into section where other
	variables are converted.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDirs: New function that changes directories
	to each of the sessiondirs contained in a nptdata object and
	evaluates a user-specified command.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/hist: Modified min and max calls to always take	
	min and max across rows.
scripts/view/@nptdata/plot: Added 'Instantiate' option to create object
	using the 'auto' option instead of loading.

	onsets and offsets, which are specified in ms, to indices when
	extracting data to be analyzed.

June 3, 2004

scripts/view/@eyejitter/hist: Added option to do contour plot. Now only
	reverses the Y-axis for imagesc and contour plots.
scripts/miscellaneous/deleteOutliers: New function from Matlab Central
	to delete outliers from data using the Grubb's Test for Outliers.
scripts/miscellaneous/getStableMean: New function that iteratively
	removes points beyond a specified standard deviation threshold and

	specified threshold.

June 4, 2004
scripts/miscellaneous/getStableMean: Added code to return std along with
	the mean.
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Added example of creating nptdata object 
	with 'Eval'	when objects are stored in sub-directories. Added tip on
	writing subsref functions for objects that inherit from other
	objects that also store all their data in the data field of their
	structure.
scripts/miscellaneous/deleteOutliers: Added modification to reduce 
	redundancy in computing deviation from mean.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/hist: Removed commented code that attempted to
	look for center of mass.

	DataStart and DataEnd values to allow different values to be used
	for different trials.
ToDo.txt: New file added to record ideas and possible improvements.

June 6, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/plot: Removed code that loaded objects for
	plotting. Now instantiates objects by default instead of only when 
	the	'Instantiate' argument is present. Using instantiation allows
	objects that are not saved in the session directory to be used more
	easily.

June 7, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDay: Added temporary fix to have ProcessDay
	call ProcessSession by default until new data hierarchy is
	implemented.

June 10, 2004
scripts/view/@eyejitter/hist: Added optional input arguments to specify
	parameters of contour plots as well as to experiment with finding
	center of mass of eye positions. Added option to find centroid of 
	oversmapled, smoothed and thresholded regions of the eye positions.
	Now also returns center x,y position.
scripts/view/gui/InspectCB: Replaced redundant calls to determine length
	of objects with variable that stores the result after 1 call.

June 11, 2004
scripts/view/@eyejitter/hist: Now rounds x- and y-mean before plotting
	and returning it. Now correctly converts center x,y to screen coords
	before returning it.

June 13, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDay: Added code so that the optional input
	arguments 'Sessions' and 'SkipSessions' will work as before. This
	code added for backward compatability until new data hierarchy
	becomes permanent.

June 15, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessGroup: Fixed typo in parsing selected
	directories.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/hist: Added contour plot of centroid region if
	Centroid argument is used. Now over-samples GaussianSize by 
	Oversample argument to make it easier to use. Changed defaults of
	Percentile from 99 to 95, GaussianSize from 5 to 10.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDirs: Added code to return arbitrary data
	without need for creating object.
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Added example of new ProcessDirs 
	functionality that returns arbitrary data.

June 16, 2004
scripts/read_files/ReadIniRF: Now adds the sessionname to the data
	structure.
scripts/view/@mapfields/mapfields: Added sessionname to default
	data structure.
scripts/view/@mapfields/plot: Now labels each RF with a number and
	adds a line to illustrates the orientation. Now ensures that the 
	fields argument	to drawfields is a column vector when drawing all 
	fields so that the RF labels will be added properly.
scripts/view/@nptdata/plot: Removed numeric second argument when
	calling plot function of object since it is redundant and it was
	conflicting with functions that used the numeric second argument 
	for other purposes.

June 17, 2004
scripts/read_files/ReadIniRF: Fixed bug that wasn't skipping properly
	over key names for receptive fields when there were more than 10 
	RFs.
scripts/view/@mapfields/mapfields: Moved initialization of empty data
	structure to createEmptyObject function so that function can be
	from within createObject without having to first initialize data.
	Removed argument to createEmptyObject as a result.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDay: Added message when day is skipped.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessSession: Added message when session is 
	skipped.
	
June 21, 2004

	class. Uses the new ReadIniGrating function to parse INI file.
scripts/view/@gratings/subsref: Subsref function for new gratings
	class.
scripts/view/@gratings/plot: Plot function for new gratings class.
scripts/view/@mapfields/getEccentricity: New function that computes
	eccentricity of fields by computing the cartesian distance between
	the fixation spot and all other fields.
scripts/view/@nptdata/isempty: New function that should allow all
	derived objects to go without creating their own isempty function.
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Added example of new ProcessDirs 
	functionality that uses the variable i to keep track of computations
	that may have variable number of rows per directory when computing
	arbitrary data. Corrected typo in spelling of nptdata.
scripts/read_files/ReadIniRF: Now stores the Presenter Version field.
scripts/read_files/@mapfields/plot: Corrected typo in help comments from
	"can not" to "cannot". Reduced the line indicating orientation of
	fields to improve visibility when other objects are plotted. Now
	turns on axis equal to make sure objects are drawn with the correct
	aspect ratio.
scripts/read_files/@mapfields/subsref: Now uses the data subfield to 
	simply access to internal data structure.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDirs: Added example of using the variable i
	to keep track of arbitrary data.
scripts/view/@streamer/get: Added varargin in order to work with 
	nptdata/InspectGUI.

June 22, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/set: Added option to set sessiondirs field which 
	also updates number field. Added description of argument type
	in help comments.
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Modified subsref example to use gratings
	and mapfields objects instead of bias and eyestarget, which are 
	not in the nptdata directories. Added tip on saving number of 
	events locally in objects. Removed extra quotes in ProcessGroup
	example when instantiating eyejitter objects.

June 23, 2004
scripts/view/@eyejitter/eyejitter: Added hchan, vhcan and onsetArg 
	fields to object structure to avoid confusing horizontal and 
	vertical channels. The onsetArg field can be used to check to see
	if a previously saved object matches the current arguments (not
	completely implemented).
scripts/view/@eyejitter/plot: Now uses the hchan and vhcan variables 
	stored in the object structure instead of defining its own 
	constants.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/loadobj: New function to update old objects.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/get: New function that returns computations on
	the eyejitter data.

June 24, 2003
scripts/view/@mapfields/get.m: New function to make it easy to return
	selected data.
scripts/miscellaneous/histn.m: Added help comment specifying which 
	column in the input data ends up in rows.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/get.m: Changed 'Threshold' to 'MaxSD'. Added
	code to call eyejitter/hist to return the center of the eye
	jitter data. Now calls eyes/get when it does not recognize the
	options.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/hist.m: Changed 'EyeJitterThreshold' to 
	'MaxSD' which is now passed to eyejitter/get so there is only
	one place where the default MaxSD is specified. Now uses call to
	eyejitter/get to get the means. Added code to switch the columns
	of the means returned from the get function to make the result
	more intuitive. Replaced constants in code with xcol and ycol
	which are defined at the beginning of the function.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/plot.m: Changed 'EyeJitterThreshold' to 
	'MaxSD' which is now passed to eyejitter/get. Changed the
	default behavior to hold plots and changed the option 'HoldPlot' 
	to 'NoHoldPlot'. Fixed code to correctly plot trial-by-trial
	data using numeric arguments. Removed code that used 
	EyeJitterThreshold and replaced with code that uses call to get
	function to figure out which trials to plot in what color.

June 25, 2004
scripts/miscellaneous/convex_intersect.m: New function from Web that 
	finds the intersection of 2 polygons.
scripts/miscellaneous/checkpoly.m: New function from Web that is used
	by convex_intersect.
scripts/miscellaneous/line_intersect.m: New function from Web that is 
	used by convex_intersect.
scripts/view/@datafile/get.m: Modified to use varargin and getOptArgs.
scripts/view/@eyes/plot.m: Modified to insert eye directory prefix
	before trying to open eye files so things will work even if the
	current directory is the session directory and not the eye 
	directory. The default directory name can be changed by using the
	EyeDir optional input argument.
scripts/view/@mapfields/get.m: Added option to return the number of RFs
	satisfying specified constraints. Re-organized code to figure out
	relevant trials before returning specified data.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDirs.m: Added help comment to warn about 
	using . to access fields in objects.
scripts/view/@nptdata/get.m: Modified to use varargin and getOptArgs.
scripts/view/@waveforms/get.m: Modified to use varargin and getOptArgs.
scripts/view/@ispikes/get.m: Added varargin to avoid problems with 
	InspectGUI, which calls get functions with varargin.
scripts/view/@mapfields/plot.m: Added option to plot fields relative to
	fixation spot. Also added options to turn off field orientation and
	field number so we can create a plot of all fields relative to
	fixation spot without too much other clutter. Added option to only
	plot fields with specified mark value.

June 27, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDirs: Added option to allow the user to 
	initialize data to something other than [] so we can add objects in
	selected directories (contained in a nptdata object) together. Added
	help comments to describe initializing data to object.

June 28, 2004
scripts/view/@mapfields/plus: New function that allows mapfields objects
	to be added together.
scripts/view/@mapfields/loadobj: New function that converts existing 
	mapfields objects to the new data structure which allows addition.
scripts/view/@mapfields/mapfields.m: Modified to add sessions and 
	numRFIndex fields to allow addition. Changed sessionname and 
	presenterversion fields to cell arrays to allow addition.
scripts/view/@mapfields/get.m: Modified to work with multi-event
	objects. Added Field option to specify field number. Added 'Marked'
	option to select fields with a non-zero mark. Added 'Indices' option
	to return indices corresponding to selected fields. Added
	'FixCenterXY' option to return fixation coordinates from the same 
	session of specified fields. Added 'SessionRFNumber' option to
	return the session field numbers. Fixed bug that called eye/get
	instead of nptdata/get.
scripts/view/@mapfields/plot.m: Modified to work with multi-event
	objects. Now can plot all fields if no numeric argument specified.
	Now uses get function to parse selected fields to reduce redundancy.
	Now only plots orientations for non-fixation fields.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDirs.m: Now uses the functional form of
	plus to allow passing optional input arguments.

June 29, 2004
scripts/view/@gratings/get.m: New function to access data. Useful when
	used inside eval statements, which don't seem to like statements of
	the form obj.data.blah.
scripts/read_files/ReadIniRF.m: Modified to call ReadIniSession to
	return session info. Now returns session info fields in addition to
	RF fields.
scripts/view/@mapfields/get.m: Added option to return conversion factors
	to go from pixels to degrees. This option is called by both plot and
	getEccentricity functions. The screen dimensions are set to 40 x 30
	degrees by default.
scripts/view/@mapfields/getEccentricity.m: Modified to work with
	multi-event objects. Now returns field number in OBJ instead of the
	0-indexed number of the fields in each session. Added option to
	compute eccentricities in degrees instead of pixels, which might not
	be equivalent if the x- and y-conversion factors are not exactly the
	same. Now calls get to figure out relevant fields.
scripts/view/@mapfields/mapfields.m: Converts the session info 
	character fields returned from ReadIniRF into cell arrays so they
	can be added together.
scripts/view/@mapfields/plot.m: Added ability to plot eccentricity
	data, which calls getEccentricity to do the calculations. Added
	option to plot data in degrees. Removed drawfields function since
	there is only 1 call to that function after converting code to use
	the get function to determine relevant fields. Code in drawfields
	function now resides in the main function in plot. Added code to
	make sure [0 0] is included in the axis range when plotting data
	with the 'FromFix' option.
scripts/view/@mapfields/plus.m: Fixed typo that was causing problems
	when second argument was an empty object. Now adds fields returned
	by ReadIniSession, which is now called by ReadIniRF. Now prints out
	a warning if ScreenHeight and ScreenWidth are not the same in the
	two object being added.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDirs.m: Fixed bug that was missing a close
	parenthesis. Code using the 'Object' optional input argument not
	working due to problems passing varargin to eval function. Now uses
	get function to get directories so we can use any object inherited
	from nptdata.
scripts/view/@nptdata/subsref: Added code to access sessiondirs field.
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Fixed typo in comment of last example.
scripts/view/@mapfields/examples.txt: New file to illustrate use of 
	mapfields objects.

June 30, 2004
scripts/view/@mapfields/get.m: Added code to remove fixation fields
	when using the Mark option since in most cases, if the user
	requests fields marked 0, they don't mean the fixation field. This
	will help in finding fields which are not marked.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/getTrialsInFields: New function that is used to
	finds trials with stable eye positions within the limits of the
	receptive fields. 
scripts/view/@eyejitter/plot: Added InFields option to call 
	getTrialsInFields with the optional input argument 'Plot'.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/examples.txt: New file to illustrate plotting 
	the distribution of included trials.
scripts/view/@ispikes/ispikes: Fixed typo in example of loading 
	previously saved ispikes object in help comments.
scripts/view/@ispikes/separate: Added example usage in help comments.

July 1, 2004
scripts/view/@ispikes/separate: Removed 'cluster' from name in example
	in help comments. Now checks for existing directories in the group
	directory and prompts user to either delete the directories or
	cancel. Added 'NoReplacePrompt' option to bypass warning. Fixed bug
	that failed to assign the cell name when there is only 1 cluster.
	Modified code to create directories to work more reliably.

July 4, 2004
scripts/view/@ispikes/ispikes.m: Removed extraneous \n in error string.

July 5, 2004
scripts/miscellaneous/histcie.m: Added code to return zero counts and 
	empty bin assignments when input is empty instead of passing the
	empty input to histc which will return an error.
scripts/view/@ispikes/gather.m: New function to return a cell array of
	all ispikes objects contained in session directory. This code used
	to be in Contours/eyestarget/plotSalienceSpikes.m.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/getTrialsInFields.m: Fixed bug in returning
	excluded points when the 'Plot' argument is not used. Now the 
	excluded points are calculated whether the 'Plot' argument is used.
scripts/view/@ispikes/ispikes.m: Now removes '_highpass' from session
	name before saving object. Fixed bug in saving object when a new 
	object is created after attempting to load an old object. Now alters
	Args.SaveLevels before calling createObject.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessSession.m: Added code to return arbitrary
	data similar to @npdata/ProcessDirs.m.

July 6, 2004
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Removed extraneous semi-colon in example of
	using '~isempty' on an object to check if the directory should be
	retained in the output nptdata object.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/getTrialsInFields.m: Removed redundant comment
	after code to find excluded points was moved.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessSession.m: Added option to specify part
	of groupname to avoid going into certain directories which might
	cause problems, e.g. avoiding the sort directories when the ispikes 
	constructor is called.
scripts/view/@streamer/loadobj.m: Retrieved from CVS and modified to
	reverse the order of the fields chunkSize and numChunks. Also now
	checks for presence of numChunks field for older streamer objects.

July 7, 2004
scripts/view/@ispikes/ispikes.m: Added 'Resave' option to allow 
	previously saved objects to be converted without regenerating. This
	is useful if the outdated object is the inherited streamer object.
	Together with the use of streamer/loadobj, objects can be updated
	and saved without regenerating, which is currently not possible for
	ispikes objects in cluster directories. Added 'ShortName' option to
	save ispikes objects as ispikes.mat instead of something like 
	clark10100303g0002_ispike.mat. This allows the ispikes objects in 
	cluster directories to be updated and saved properly.

July 13, 2004
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessSession.m: Replaced typo 'highpass' with
	'highpassflag' in code that extracts spikes after computing mean
	and standard deviation.
scripts/view/@eyejitter/getTrialsInFields.m: Added option to specify
	radius of inclusion instead of using receptive fields.
scripts/view/@nptdata/plot.m: Added option to pass optional arguments
	for the instantiation of objects before plotting. This allows 
	objects to be regenerated on the fly if we want to test out
	different parameters. Now also checks for the presence of optional
	arguments so the user can leave them out if there are not being
	used.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessCell.m: Fixed code that calls the
	constructor for the input object along with any optional input
	arguments. This removes the need for there to be a ProcessCell
	method in each class. 
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDirs.m: Fixed code that calls the
	constructor, along with any optional input argument using feval.
	This simplifies the call when computing objects that are to be added
	together and returned.
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Removed example of using the 'Instantiate'
	optional input argument with nptdata/plot since that is now the 
	default. Added tips on using the batch processing functionality of
	the nptdata class.

July 14, 2003
scripts/view/@streamer/plot.m: Added code to search for .bin streamer
	files in parent directories in case we are calling InspectGUI on
	an ispikes object from the cluster directory. Need to add similar
	code for trial-based streamer files. (Removed since we are going
	to try to modify streamer object so it can figure out where its
	data is located.)
scripts/view/@nptGroup: New class for npt group data.
scripts/view/@nptGroup/nptGroup.m: Constructor for new nptGroup class.
scripts/view/@nptGroup/plot.m: Plot function for new nptGroup class.
scripts/view/@nptGroup/subsref.m: Subsref function for new nptGroup
	class.

July 15, 2004
scripts/view/@ispikes/get.m: Modified to use getOptArgs. Changed format
	of calls so there might be problems with code that called it using
	the old format. Did a grep to check npt, Contours and fvt and didn't
	find any code that is using the old format. Added code to tell
	nptGroup/plot to separate group plots.
scripts/view/@ispikes/plot.m: Added code to format group plots, which 
	get calls by nptGroup/plot. Fixed bug that was attempting to plot
	streamer data even if the 'showStreamer' optional input argument was
	not specified. Commented out code that was only plotting spikes with
	times between axis points. Modifed code to plot spikes so it does
	not use a for loop.
scripts/view/@nptGroup/nptGroup.m: Added help comments. Changed
	'GroupName' option to 'CellName' to correctly reflect use of the
	variable.
scripts/view/@nptGroup/plot.m: Removed 'Separate' optional input
	argument. Now removes optional input arguments relevant only to this
	function. Now correctly makes cellDirs a cell array. Added code to
	sub-divide current axis into either horizontal or vertical sections
	depending on the 'GroupPlotProperties' of the object being plotted.
	Now passes group plot information to plot function of objects so
	they can format the plots appropriately. Fixed typo in command to
	set the title.
scripts/view/@nptdata/get.m: Added code to handle 'GroupPlotProperties'
	query from nptGroup/plot so all object inherited from nptdata will
	work with nptGroup/plot.

July 16, 2004
scripts/view/@ispikes/createClusterNamesFile.m: New function that uses
	directory structure created by previous calls to ispikes/separate
	to generate the ClusterNames files if it is missing.
scripts/view/@ispikes/ispikes.m: Fixed bug that was saving cell ispikes 
	objects with the name for group ispikes objects. Added lastwarn
	calls so that try-catch code will work when trying to load outdated
	objects. Replaced call to ReadClusterNamesFile with textread as 
	ReadClusterNamesFile was not working. Fixed code that was returning
	the group ispikes object instead of the cell ispikes object when the
	constructor was called from the cluster directory. Fixed typo in
	comment about callling separate.
scripts/view/@ispikes/loadobj.m: Re-added to convert saved objects that
	were inherited from streamer to the new format.
scripts/view/@ispikes/plot.m: Fixed code for plotting trial-based data.

July 19, 2004
scripts/view/@nptGroup/plot.m: Moved code to separate axis into separate
	function separateAxis so it can be called by other functions.
scripts/miscellaneous/separateAxis.m: New function to separate axis.
scripts/view/@nptdata/InspectGUI.m: Moved parsing of optional arguments
	before call to get event number so we will be using the right
	object. Now also passes to the get function the optional arguments 
	passed to the plot function so event number will be correct.
scripts/view/@nptGroup/get.m: New function that gets the event number
	from the object used for plotting to return to InspectGUI.

July 20, 2004
scripts/miscellaneous/mtspec.m: Fixed bug that was rounding instead of 
	doing floor when computing number of windows in a time series.
scripts/view/@nptdata/InspectGUI.m: Fixed bug in passing cell array 
	contents of s.optargs when calling get. Moved call to get after 
	code that initializes s.optargs when there is only 1 object.
scripts/view/@nptGroup/plot.m: Added help comments to describe function.
scripts/view/@nptdata/InspectGUI.m: Now correctly packages optional
	arguments into s.optargs when not using the optArgs input argument.
	Now correctly uses the first object instead of the i-th object in
	call to get event number.
scripts/view/@nptdata/plot.m: Modified cell array of objects so the 
	object, the plot options and the constructor options are all
	contained in one cell array. This correctly allows plot options and
	constructor options to be optional. Updated help comments to reflect
	new change.
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Updated to reflect changes in cell array
	argument used in nptdata/plot.
	
July 23, 2004
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessSession.m: Fixed bug that was trying to
	extract spikes when the extraction flag is specified but there are 
	no relevant signals present. Now exits if a data file is found to be
	empty (possibly due to an incomplete session) so it won't encounter
	problems trying to create subsequent files.
scripts/view/@checksystem/plot.m: Added session name to plot. Now prints
	out the name of the last trial so we can figure out if we all the
	trials were analyzed. Now prints out the trial numbers of the trials 
	with irregular sync intervals.
scripts/batch_processor/MoveProcessedFiles.m: Moved code for unix
	to ProcessDay so we can display output more easily instead of having
	to add another ouput argument.
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessDay.m: Added code for unix to move
	processed files from MoveProcessedFiles.m. Now prints out the output
	of moveprocessedfiles.tcsh so we can figure out what happened. Now
	calls system instead of making separate calls to dos and unix when
	using moveprocessedfiles.tcsh to move files on PCs or Unix.
scripts/view/@nptGroup/get.m: Fixed bug that was overwriting plotObject
	with the instantiated object. Now correctly adds 'Number' to call to
	the get function of the instantiated object so there is no confusion
	about what property is being requested. Now passes only the optional 
	input arguments for the plot function to the get function to avoid 
	confusion.
scripts/view/@ispikes/get.m: Fixed bug that was not returning a value
	when GroupPlotProperties is 1. Now correctly passes all arguments
	in varargin to nptdata/get instead of just the first argument so
	GroupPlotProperties will work properly.
scripts/view/@ispikes/plot.m: Now correctly changes duration to 
	milliseconds before using it to set the x-axis limits.

July 26, 2004
scripts/miscellaneous/dirLevel.m: Now returns the current directory when
	it is unable to determine the directory structure so as to improve 
	compatability with un-organized data.
scripts/view/@ispikes/separate.m: CellNames is now an optional input
	argument so if it is not specified, the function checks uses the
	the ClusterNames file if it is present and returns an error 
	otherwise. Updated help comments to reflect new change.
scripts/view/@ispikes/ispikes.m: Now calls separate without CellNames
	so the ClusterNames file will be read.
scripts/view/@streamer/streamer.m: Fixed the order of the fields so it
	is consistent across all the diffferent ways of creating an object.

July 28, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/nptdata.m: Added option to specify number and
	session directory separately since the 'SessionDirs' option would
	use the number of rows in SessionDirs to overwrite the number field.
	Made HoldAxis an optional input argument so the constructor can be 
	called more easily. Updated help comments to describe new usage. Now
	converts SessionDirs to cell array if it is not a cell array.
scripts/view/@eyes/eyes.m: Updated call to nptdata constructor so it
	uses the new usage to correctly create nptdata object with the right
	number in the number field.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessSession.m: Added help comments to describe
	GroupDirName option.
scripts/view/@streamer/streamer.m: Updated call to nptdata constructor
	so it uses the new usage to correctly create nptdata object with 
	the right number in the number field.

July 29, 2004
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessSession.m: Now skips analysis of sync
	monitor files if there is a mismatch between the number of sync
	monitor files and the number of data files.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDay.m: Added DayObject optional input
	argument so objects no longer need to define a ProcessDay function.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessGroup.m: Added GroupObject optional input
	argument so object no longer need to define a ProcessGroup function.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessSession.m: Added GroupSession optional
	input argument so object no longer need to define a ProcessSession 
	function.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessSite.m: Added SiteObject optional input
	argument so object no longer need to define a ProcessSite function.
scripts/view/@nptdata/nptdata.m: Added code to create object from a 
	derived object so we can simply the creation of nptdata objects that
	contain directories in which user specified objects were present.
	Moved code to create empty object into new sub-function so it can be
	called from various places in the constructor.
scripts/view/@nptdata/plus.m: Now prints warning if there is a mismatch
	in the number of events and the number of sesssiondirs, except when
	sessiondirs is empty.
scripts/view/@nptdata/set.m: Now make sure sessiondirs is a cell array
	before updating object. Now gets the number of events from the 
	number of columns in sessiondirs.
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Added description of nptdata class. Added
	description of new LevelObject optional input argument for batch
	processing functions. Updated nptdata calls to remove the first 2
	redundant arguments when using optional input arguments. Updated
	example of eyejitter class usage to use PresenterTrigger optional
	input argument. Updated examples to make use of the fact that
	nptdata/plus can be called correctly when there are no plus 
	functions in an user class. Expanded comments on overloading get
	function. Added example of instantiating an nptdata object from a
	derived object that does not have a plus function in its class.

July 30, 2004
scripts/view/@eyes/plot.m: Now correctly gets the session directory
	from the nptdata object, which is a cell array, and uses the 
	contents of the cell array instead of the cell array itself, to
	change directories. The output argument varargout was being returned
	with items that were only relevant when the 'XY' option was not 
	used. This problem has been fixed so it now correctly returns 
	different varargout when the 'XY' option is used or when it is not
	used.
scripts/view/@nptdata/InspectGUI.m: Now only turns on linkedzoom for
	objects that request it.
scripts/view/gui/InspectCB.m: Now only turns on linkedzoom for objects
	that request it.
scripts/view/@streamer/plot.m: Added semi-colon to varargout command to
	suppress unnecessary output.

August 2, 2004
algorithms/nptSpikeTimesFFT.m: Now calls histcie with the DataCols 
	option so a row vector is treated as separate data series with one 
	data point each.
scripts/miscellaneous/getOptArgs.m: NumericArguments is now initialized
	to an empty matrix instead of a cell array containing an empty
	matrix since that was returning false when used with isempty.
scripts/miscellaneous/histcie.m: Added DataCols option so that a row 
	vector can be processed as separate data series with one data point
	each.
scripts/view/@nptdata/nptdata.m: Updated examples in help to remove
	first two arguments when using optional input arguments.

August 5, 2004
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Added example of using ProcessDirs to
	select a subset of directories from a nptdata object to create
	another nptdata object.
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessDay.m: Added code to deal with new
	directory structure.
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessEyeSessions.m: Added code to deal with
	new directory structure.
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessSession.m: Modified code to get session
	name so it will work with both the old and new directory structure.
	Moved printing of newline to after call to ExtractorWrapper to
	improve legibility of progress messages. Now turns off diary (if it
	is on) before calling RunClustBatch and turns it back on afterwards.
	This will only work if the diary command is called in the following
	fashion: diary([pwd filesep 'diary']).
scripts/batch_processor/getDXYData.m: Added code to deal with new
	directory structure.
scripts/batch_processor/moveprocessedfiles.tcsh: Modified to work with
	both old and new directory structures.

August 6, 2004
scripts/miscellaneous/OrganizeData.m: Now returns error message in 
	error dialog box.

August 10, 2004
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessSession.m: Moved code that calls 
	RunClustBatch inside the loop that checks for the presence of the
	variable unitextracted so RunClustBatch is run only when units
	are extracted. This change was necessary as ProcessSession was 
	interrupted while running KlustaKwik and I just wanted it to
	generate the dxy files, which follows the call to RunClustBatch.
	Fixed bugs in re-extracting spikes from highpass files in highpass
	directory.
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessEyeSessions.m: Now creates
	processedeyes.txt only in sessions where data was processed instead
	of every directory it checks. This change was necessary to reduce
	the number of files that have to be manually deleted when different
	sessions have different eye calibration sessions.

August 11, 2004
scripts/read_files/ReadDescriptor.m: Added command to close file. This 
	might one of the reasons why there are problems moving data or 
	unmounting drives even if it appears Matlab is no longer working on
	any data files.

August 12, 2004
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessDay.m: Fixed bug in checking the return
	value of the call to cygwin to move files.

August 16, 2004
scripts/batch_processor/kkwrapper: Added to cvs control shell script 
	used to launch parallel	KlustaKwik processes. Added code to search 
	for best score after all KlustaKwik processes for a group have
	completed. 
scripts/batch_processor/kkewrapper: Added to cvs control shell script 
	used to launch parallel	KlustaKwik processes with a penalty mix
	argument of 1. Added code to search for best score after all 
	KlustaKwik processes for a group have completed. 
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDirs: Updated help comments to illustrate
	correct use of the Object argument.

August 20, 2004
scripts/view/@nptGroup/plot.m: Fixed missing quote in help comments.
	Now sets plot and constructor option to empty cell arrays if they
	are not present so we can use the same code regardless of how many
	columns in Object are passed into the function.
scripts/miscellaneous/getOptArgs.m: Removed double-spacing that somehow
	crept into the file. Added code to use the 'flags' field in
	ArgStruct if 'flags' is not specified, and also to add the 'flags'
	field if the 'flags' is specified.
scripts/view/@dirfiles: New class to act as template.
scripts/view/@dirfiles/dirfiles.m: Constructor for template class.
scripts/view/@dirfiles/subsref.m: Subsref function for template class.
scripts/view/@dirfiles/plus.m: Plus function for template class.

August 23, 2004
scripts/miscellaneous/nptMkDir.m: New function to create directory if it
	is not already present and return error if there is a problem
	creating the directory.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessCellCombos.m: New function to process
	objects that compute data from pairs of cells.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessGroup.m: Added option to specify names of
	cluster directories. Useful for selecting single units (using '*s')
	or multi-units (using '*m').
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessSession.m: Added option to call new
	function ProcessCellCombos if the get function of an object returns
	a value that is not 'Single'.
scripts/view/@nptdata/get.m: Added code to return an AnalysisLevel of
	'Single' for all objects by default. This allows all objects to work
	with the new code in ProcessSession that checks for objects that
	require the function ProcessCellCombos.
scripts/view/@nptdata/nptdata.m: Added code to create nptdata objects
	containing the current directory using the 'auto' option. This makes
	it easy to generate cell arrays of directories either from the
	session or group directory, which is used in ProcessCellCombos.

August 24, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDirs.m: Changed isempty call to ischar when
	checking for the presence of the Object argument since empty objects 
	are typically passed to the function and the isempty function of 
	nptdata will get called and return true.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessSession.m: Changed default GroupDirName to
	'group*' since that seems to be the most commonly used.
doc/view-nptdata-usage.txt: Added example usage of using ProcessDirs to
	go to each session directory and calling ProcessSession and then
	adding the objects returned by ProcessSession together.
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessCellCombos.m: Fixed bug so now both 
	IntraGroup and InterGroup pairs are correctly calculated when 
	neither optional input arguments are specified.

August 25, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessGroup.m: Now converts the Cells and 
	SkipCells arguments to full paths and does all comparisons using
	the full path in order to be able to specify directories from
	a function like ProcessDays.

August 27, 2004
algorithms/nptSpikeTimesFFT.m: Now creates spike trains that are as
	long as the last spike time instead of using the duration argument
	to specify the length. Removed duration argument.
scripts/view/@nptdata/plus.m: Now if one of the arguments is not an
	nptdata object, the other is returned. If both are not nptdata
	objects, then an empty nptdata object is returned. This allows the
	objects created in the nptDirCmd option of ProcessDirs to be added
	without having to call the DataInit option.
scripts/view/@dirfiles/plus.m: Added new plus code in nptdata/plus to
	template plus function.
scripts/view/@nptdata/InspectGUI.m: Fixed bug in spelling of s.Arg when
	the object does not return plot arguments.

August 30, 2004
scripts/view/@dirfiles/plus.m: Added code to check for empty objects
	in case empty objects are going to cause problems (e.g. 
	Cat/@FMagnitude/plus.m). 

September 1, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessCellCombos.m: Added comment about the
	utility of using ProcessGroup to skip directories with skip.txt just
	in case we start wondering why we are gathering directories with
	ProcessGroup before doing the calculations.
	
September 3, 2004	
algorithms/nptSpikeTimesFFT.m: Now returns time vector for
	time-frequency plots. Removed Duration field from Args. Now returns
	empty output arguments if the data is empty. Now rounds up number of
	segments to include all data instead of truncating last fraction of
	data. Now correctly uses noOverlapLength instead of BinSize to
	ensure correct segment sizes.
scripts/miscellaneous/nptDir.m: Added code to work around bug in Matlab
	dir function when doing a directory listing on a mounted Windows
	filesystem from Macs.

September 7, 2004
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessSession.m: Now also checks timingflag to
	see if we need to loop through trials. This is necessary if 'timing'
	is the only flag specified.

September 8, 2004
scripts/miscellaneous/getOptArgs.m: Now converts shortcuts to lowercase
	so case will not matter when specifying shortcuts.
scripts/view/@dirfiles/dirfiles.m: Now adds the flags field separately
	to the Args strcuture. This might make it more apparent that the
	flags field is really a one-level cell array rather than the double-
	level cell array that is required when initializing within the
	struct call.

September 9, 2004
scripts/miscellaneous/concatenate.m: Added code to concatenate data
	columnwise so we don't have to transpose before and after calling
	concatenate if we want to append data columnwise. Added code to
	only concatenate vectors that are not empty.
scripts/read_files/ReadRevCorrIniJonathan.m: Added check for empty 
	Matrix field.
scripts/view/@dirfiles/dirfiles.m: Now removes the 'Auto' argument from
	varargin and stores the varargin returned from getOptArgs under a
	different names so nargin will work properly. Otherwise, if 'Auto'
	is removed by getOptArgs, nargin will return 0. Replaced redundant 
	nargin calls with a variable that is set by one call to nargin.

September 10, 2004
scripts/view/@dirfiles/dirfiles.m: Fixed bug that closed the struct
	command for Args with a "}" instead of a ")".
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessCellCombos.m: Added code to create the 
	combinations directory only when there are cluster pairs to
	process.
scripts/miscellaneous/concatenate.m: Removed code that only
	concatenated vectors that are not empty since functions such as
	Cat/CreateRaster are expecting the old behavior.

September 15, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/ProcessDay.m: Now calls ProcessSite by default. 
	Replaced 'UseSites' argument with 'NoSites' to specify old behavior.
	Now no longer adds eyecal directory to SkipSites if SkipSites is not
	empty. This allows the checksystem objects to be created for eye
	calib sessions as well. Added code to remove arguments specific to
	this function so that the checksystem constructor will not get
	confused.
scripts/miscellaneous/concatenate.m: Added code to properly concatenate
	a scalar value and an empty matrix as it was causing problems
	with the jointevents object.

September 16, 2004
scripts/miscellaneous/dirLevel.m: Added code to return name prefixes for
	the	various kinds of directories (e.g. cluster, group, session, 
	etc.). We will try to make this function the repository for 
	directory specific information so we will not have to change a whole
	bunch of functions if the directory hierarchy changes.
scripts/view/@nptdata/groupDirs.m: New function to group indices 
	according to group. This can be used with cummulative objects like 
	the responsiveness object to calculate the standard deviation of the
	responsiveness within a group.

September 21, 2004
scripts/batch_processor/ProcessEyeSessions.m: Fixed bug that was not
	returning to parent directory if a skip.txt was found in a session.

September 27, 2004
scripts/view/@nptdata/name2index.m: Added check for empty sessiondirs
	so we won't try to do anything with empty cell arrays. Now returns 0
	if sessiondirs is empty.
scripts/miscellaneous/dirLevel.m: Changed relative option to Relative so
	we can use R as a shortcut.

October 1, 2004
scripts/view/@nptgroup: Changed nptgroup to lower case so objects saved
	on Windows will work with non-Windows machines.
scripts/view/@nptgroup/get.m: Changed case of nptgroup.
scripts/view/@nptgroup/nptgroup.m: Changed case of nptgroup.
scripts/view/@nptgroup/plot.m: Changed case of nptgroup.
scripts/view/@nptgroup/subsref.m: Changed case of nptgroup.
