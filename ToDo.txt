To do:

@nptdata
--------
Add plot options GUI to InspectGUI that uses overloaded function from
each class to fill GUI.

Add function to merge fields of Args structure and merge the flags field.
The function should warn if there are conflicts in the names of arguments. 
This way the user can rename arguments in their objects	when debugging 
their objects. Set up code to check Args along with Args from subfunctions 
as well as to ignore fields like RedoLevel and SaveLevels. 

Replace allg2 combinations directories with abbreviated actual directories so objects can figure out where to go. This will also make it more tolerant to changes in the constituent cluster directories. 

Add try-catch around new call to plot that expects a second output
argument. The catch statements should try to create the Args
from s.optArgs (won't work with flags but it is better than nothing).

Make InspectGUI call InspectCB so as to reduce redundancy in code.

Incorporate panGUI to InspectGUI.

Add code to panGUI to store original limits in order to allow zooming 
out.

Revamp ProcessDays, ProcessDay, etc. to call one function (e.g. 
LoopOverDirs) so additions can be made once for all functions. The
functions ProcessDays, ProcessDay will still have to exist since that
will be the way those functions will be overloaded by derived classes.
However, these functions will ideally contain just a call to 
LoopOverDirs.

Add 'ispresent' option to ProcessDays, ProcessDay, etc. so users won't
have to specify long quoted strings on the command line when trying to 
create nptdata directories that only contain directories in which certain
objects exist or certain criterae are fulfilled.

Add '~isempty' option to ProcessDays, ProcessDay, etc. so users won't
have to specify long quoted strings on the command line. (Use ~isempty
instead of ispresent to work with objects that are saved in a
sub-directory instead of the cell directory.

Modify InspectGUI to parse optional input arguments when using multiple
objects in a manner similar to nptdata/plot.

Look into merging nptdata and nptgroup so that some of the plot 
functionality won't have to be replicated in both classes.

Modify InspectGUI so linkedzoom can be turned on for selected subplots.

Modify dxy file generation to ignore extra files.

Move subplot code in @nptdata/plot to nptSubplot.

Update checksystem class to use new nptdata framework.

Modifiy optional input argument addObjs for InspectGUI to include 
optional arguments instead of having to use optArgs input argument.

Debug nptRemoveLineNoise.

Ignore Next or Previous if we are already at the limit of events so we
don't waste time redrawing.

General
-------
Set up test scripts for different types of data to make sure new changes
will work for all data.

When using 'auto', objects should check if previously saved object has
the same requested arguments.
