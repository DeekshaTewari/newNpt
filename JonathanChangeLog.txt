Change Log for matlab functions used to analyze cat data

\npt\scripts\miscellaneous
	Committed the function OrganizeData which should be run under the day directory or
	in the cat data, the experiment directory. The function reads a .txt file which contains
	the recording site information and then reorganizes the data from a day/session data 
	hierarchy to a day/site/session data hierarchy. The function should only be run after all 
	of the data is located in the day directory. This should be changed to account for partial
	structures.

	Made major changes to the function OrganizeData. It will now delete and remove data properly, previously
	it could not handle numerous sub directories like sort and FD folders.

\npt\scripts\read_files\ReadOldRevCorrIni
    Made a change to the M-Seq and Sparse Noise Cases. Old ini files write out the grid center and new ini files 
    write out the x and y centers. Changed the function to write out the x and y centers to be consistent across 
    different data. Also included a field m_seq_size: '64x64 (order=16)', since it's not written out in the old 
    data.

\npt\scripts\view\@nptdata\groupDirs
    Modified the function to account for IntraGroup, InterGroup and Pairs of cells within Groups, currently the 
    InterGroup portion does not work.
