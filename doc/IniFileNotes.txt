Ini File Notes:

Eye Calibration Sessions
 -- from '01 to early '03 Eye Cal. ini's had all of the same fields and subfields.

Fields: [SESSION INFO], 
	[RECEPTIVE FIELDS INFO], 
	[STIMULUS INFO], 
	[TIMING INFO], 
	[STIMULUS SEQUENCE]



In early '03 the following changes were made:

"Presenter Version" subfield added to [SESSION INFO]

[RECEPTIVE FIELDS INFO] renamed [RECEPTIVE FIELDS] and the following subfields were added:
	Section Version=1
	uDim
	vDim
	Spat Freq
	Velocity
	Mark

The following subfields were added to [TIMING INFO]:   (note:  "Paradigm" was removed.)
	Section Version=1
	Cue Latency
	Cue Latency Max
	Randomize Cue Latency
	Cue Duration
	Cue Duration Max
	Randomize Cue Duration
	Post Cue Duration
	Post Cue Duration Max
	Randomize Post Cue Duration
	Match Latency
	Match Latency Max
	Randomize Match Latency
	Match Time Limit

In '04 the following subfields were added to [TIMING INFO]:  (Section Version=2)
	Incorrect Penalty Duration
	Incorrect Penalty Duration Max
	Randomize Incorrect Penalty Duration



Reverse Correlation Sessions (Monkey only)
 -- in early '01, Rev Corr. ini's had the following characteristics:

Fields: [SESSION INFO],
	[RECEPTIVE FIELDS INFO],
	[OBJECT INFO],			(Only for Sparse Noise sessions)
	[STIMULUS INFO],
	[EXTRA SYNCS],
	[FIRST FRAMES PER TRIAL]

under [STIMULUS INFO],  the following "Type" strings were used:
	TRIAL_SPARSE-NOISE
	WINDOW_MOVIE
The [STIMULUS INFO] sections for these two types of sessions are different
 from each other as well as being different from those of eye cal sessions.
 Note:  If the session was still images, there was a subfield
	"Movie type=still_image" which appeared only in this case.


In late '01 the [TIMING INFO] field was added.  (only change)

In early '03 widespread changes were made.
The changes made to the [SESSION INFO], [RECEPTIVE FIELDS INFO], and [TIMING INFO] fields has been previously described.

The [OBJECT INFO] field was removed and non-eye calibration sessions contained 
[TReverseCorrGUIForm] instead of [STIMULUS INFO].
Virtually every subfield was renamed, and many were added so that all of the
different session types would have similar [TReverseCorrGUIForm] sections.
Here are the main changes/notes:
	"Type" became "Reverse Corr Type" which is either a 0, 1, or 2
		0 = M-Sequence, 1 = Sparse Noise, 2 = Movie
	The fields "Matrix" and "Number of Frames" were refer ONLY to the m-sequence stimulus.
		For "Matrix," 0 = 16x16 and 1 = 64x64
		"Number of Frames" is legitimate ONLY if the session was an m-sequence.
	"Directions per Orientation is numeric:  0 = 1, 1 = 2
	"Random Order is numeric:  0 = Psueso-random, 1 = Blocked Orientation, 2 = Sequential
	"Contrast Polarity" is numeric:  0 = On/Off, 1 = On, 2 = Off
	"Object Type" is numeric:  0 = Bar, 1 = Gabor, 2 = Spot, 3 = Grating, 4 = Square
	"Frames in Movie" refers to the length of the entire movie file.
	"Frames" identifies the minimum number of total frames shown ONLY if the
		session was a movie or sparse noise stimulus.
	"StimFrames" is the number of different movie frames shown.  (So "Frames" will
		either be less than or an integer multiple of "StimFrames")
	"Number of Repeats" identifies the integer multiple as described above.
	"Windowed Movie" = 1 if the session is free viewing.
	"Movie type" is now "Still Images" (= 1).
	"Play Continuously" is mistaken.  At this point when it = 0, the stimulus
		plays continuously, meaning that after an incomplete trial, the stimulus
		continues, as opposed to returning to the frame immediately after the 
		last frame of the last complete trial (termed "Play Identical").
	"Trial Repeats" is the correct "Play Continuously" variable.
	"Number of Trials" here is unreliable.  It is actually the MINIMUM number of trials.
	"Screen Resolution" is numeric.  6 = 800x600

Three new other fields were also added:

	[TRIAL INFO] has the subfields "Number Trials" and "SN Block Length"
	[LAST FRAMES PER TRIAL]
	[NUMBER OF FRAMES SHOWN PER TRIAL]


In late '03 several fields were added or changed to clarify these earlier changes:
All of the fields that were previously numeric were changed to contain text info.
For instance "Reverse Corr Type" could now be "M-Sequence," "Sparse Noise," or "Movie."
The numeric fields were kept, and the word "Index" was added to each.
Other changes:
	"Object Colors" became "Number of Colors"
	"Play Continuously" was removed.
	"Orientation Angle" became "Base Orientation Angle"
	The [TRIAL INFO] field was removed.
	The [OBJECT INFO] field exists if the session was "Sparse Noise".
		note:  The subfields now say "Orientation Angle 0" instead of
		"Orientation of Bar 0", and "Surface Size" no longer exists. 

In '04 more changes were made (including those already discussed in the [TIMING INFO} field),
many to account for new jittering grading and restricted movie stimuli.
In the [TReverseCorrGUIForm] field the following subfields were added:
	"Number of Frames" was changed to "Mseq Frames"
	Mseq Start Frame
	Mseq End Frame
	Mseq Stimulus Frames		(like "StimFrames" for a movie)
	Mseq Number Of Repeats
	Temporal Frequency
	Total Frames			(Total number of sparse noise frames)
	Duration in Frames		(of a grating sparse noise stimulus)
	Jittering File Name
	Use Jittering File
	"StimFrames" became "Stimulus Frames"
	Enable Window 1
	X Center For Small Movie Window 1
	Y Center For Small Movie Window 1	
	Diameter For Small Movie Window 1
	Enable Window 2
	X Center For Small Movie Window 2
	Y Center For Small Movie Window 2
	Diameter For Small Movie Window 2
	"Number of Trials" was renamed "Minimum Number Of Trials"

Lastly, the field [ACTUAL NUMBER OF TRIALS SHOWN] was added, with the lone subfield
	"Number of Trials"
