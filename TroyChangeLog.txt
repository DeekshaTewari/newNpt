npt Change Log (Troy)

June 9, 2004
Removed redundant code in ReadRevCorrIni.m  (iniInfo.still_images was being assigned 
to 0 even though it had been previously initialized to that value).

June 21, 2004
The format of "PostStimulus Duration" was different in older ini files than current
ones.  I've changed the appropriate "case" command in ReadRevCorrIni so that either works.

August 31, 2004
Changed nptThreshold so that regions of the inspected data > (mean + 4sigma) are
removed instead of set to the mean.  Also, if the data has multiple channels, these
are kept separate.

October 20, 2004
Created 2 new scripts: ReadNewStimulusHeader and ReadNewStimulusFrame from their older counterparts.
Both include the same change; instead of creating a name and path for the stimulus file from the
.ini file, the user must input the filename (including path).

April 21, 2005
Corrected a view bugs (incorrect variable names) in nptReadDXYFile.m
Removed some arguments in nptdata\ProcessDay and ProcessSession so that other arguments were passed
on to the next level.
